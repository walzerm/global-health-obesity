###Comparison of Gender Obersity/Overweight Prevalence Between Genders

This is a D3.js world map which compares the prevalence of obesity and overweight populations between genders in the 20-24 years old age group. Each county is color coded according to the difference in mean prevalence. If the rates are equal between men and women, the country is depicted as white. A higher prevalence of male overweight/obesity rates is shown as blue, and conversely fuchsia for higher female rates.

The slider at the top can be adjusted to view changes in distribution over a period ranging from 1990-2013.

You can see the graph in action [here](http://walzerm.github.io/global-health-obesity/) on github pages.

The data was obtained from a study by the [Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME)](http://ghdx.healthdata.org/record/global-burden-disease-study-2013-gbd-2013-obesity-prevalence-1990-2013). The D3.js slider was from [here](https://github.com/MasterMaps/d3-slider) and the map template is from [vida.io](https://vida.io/gists/oaYRaR8EwvpEnXBbM).
